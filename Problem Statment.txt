Problem Statement: Lithionpower is the largest provider of electric vehicle(e-vehicle) batteries.
It provides battery on a rental model to e-vehicle drivers. Drivers rent battery typically for a day and then replace it with a charged battery from the company.
Lithionpower has a variable pricing model based on driver's driving history. Battery life depends on factors
such as over speeding, distance driven per day, etc.

Objective:
• Create a cluster model where drivers can be grouped together based on the driving data.
• Group the datapoints so that drivers will be incentivized based on the cluster
